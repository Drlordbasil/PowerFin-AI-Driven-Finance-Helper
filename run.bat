Sure! Here is the contents of the run.bat file that will help the user run the program locally on their PC along with installing the required dependencies from the requirements.txt file:

```batch
@echo off
echo Installing required dependencies...
pip install -r requirements.txt

echo Running main.py...
python main.py

echo Program execution completed.
pause
```

Just copy and paste the above code into a new file and save it as "run.bat". Place the "run.bat" file into the same directory where "main.py" and "requirements.txt" files are located. Double-clicking the "run.bat" file will execute the program.
