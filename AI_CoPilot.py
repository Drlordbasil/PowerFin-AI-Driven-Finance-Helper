Here are some optimizations for the given Python script:

- Use a default argument for the `RetryHelper` class constructor to make the code more flexible.
- Move the `transactions` list outside of the `track_expenses` method and pass it as a parameter to promote reusability.
- Use a `defaultdict` to simplify the expense tracking logic in the `ExpenseTracker` class .
- Use `sum` directly on the `values()` of the `expenses` dictionary in the `Budget` class to calculate `total_expenses`.
- Remove the unnecessary `_suggest_spending_limits` function in the `FinancialAssistant` class .
- Simplify the execution of the autonomous program by removing unnecessary method calls.

Here's the optimized code:

```python


class RetryError(Exception):
    pass


class RetryHelper:
    def __init__(self, max_retries=3, delay=1):
        self.max_retries = max_retries
        self.delay = delay

    def retry(self, func):
        tries = 0
        while tries < self.max_retries:
            try:
                return func()
            except RetryError:
                tries += 1
                time.sleep(self.delay)

        raise RetryError("Exceeded maximum number of retries")

            amount = transaction.amount

            categories[category] += amount
            total_spending += amount

        spending_patterns = {

            print("Spending patterns:")
            for category, percentage in spending_patterns.items():
                print(f"- {category}: {percentage:.2f}%")

        self.retry_helper.retry(_analyze_spending_patterns)

    def set_budget(self):

        )

    def suggest_spending_limits(self):
        spending_limits = self.budget.suggest_spending_limits()
        print("Suggested spending limits:")
        for category, limit in spending_limits.items():
            print(f"- {category}: ${limit:.2f}")

    def execute_autonomous_program(self, transactions):
        self.track_expenses(transactions)
        self.analyze_spending_patterns()

        self.set_budget()
        self.suggest_spending_limits()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    transactions = [
        Transaction("Food", 50),
        Transaction("Rent", 1000),
        Transaction("Transportation", 100),
        Transaction("Food", 30),
        Transaction("Entertainment", 80),

Please note that these optimizations focus on improving code readability, reusability, and performance. However, depending on the specific requirements and constraints of the project, further optimizations may be necessary.
